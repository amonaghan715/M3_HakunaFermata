# Song Narrative
The song begins in a quiet forest with soft footstps through fallen leaves to set the scene. You called through the forest by soft tones/chimes that slowly grow in volume as you approach your destination. You step into a clearing with magic humming in the air around you, and approach a glowing archway in a tree across the clearing. Stepping through the archway, you are met with a magical sight. Tiny orbs of light appear and drift in the space around you, and what appeared as a tree on the outside is actually an impossibly vast and magical space. A library that holds all of the magical knowledge of the forest. You explore the library for a time, and come across a spiral staircase deep in its heart. The tones that called you to the library now urge you on once again, so you ascend the stairs. As you ascend the stairs, a deep pulse begins in your bones; you are approaching a deep truth. You reach the top of the stairs and everything ceases. A preternatural silence fills the space as you approach what you have found: a glowing tome in floating in the center of the room. This is what has been calling you forward. You open the book, and a wave of magic and knowledge pulses out from it washing over you and echoing through the forest. The wisdom of the library and the forest has called to you, and now is now yours to protect and share. You leave the library and walk through the forest once more, but you are changed, and the chimes and tones and lights of the library linger in your mind as you consider what your next path will be.

# AI Usage Statement
Chat GPT 5.1 was used in the creation of this project as a resource on what scales and sounds to use to achieve specific effects. This included the idea to use the lydian scale to achieve “magical” and  “bright” tones, and how to achieve a brown noise effect.

Prompts used:
- What musical scale would achieve a bright, magical tone?
- What is brown noise compared to white noise?
